# âœ… Persona AI Expo App - ISSUES FIXED!

## ðŸŽ‰ **STATUS: ALL ISSUES RESOLVED**

Both the conversation history and TTS functionality are now working correctly in the Expo app!

## ðŸ”§ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. âœ… **Conversation History Now Persists** 
- **Problem**: Messages disappeared when closing/reopening the chat modal
- **Solution**: Implemented `useChatMessages` custom hook with AsyncStorage persistence
- **Result**: Conversation history now persists across app sessions

### 2. âœ… **TTS Now Works in Expo**
- **Problem**: Text-to-Speech wasn't functional in the Expo app
- **Solution**: Created `useTTS` custom hook with platform-specific audio handling
- **Result**: TTS works on both web and native platforms with proper caching

### 3. âœ… **Transport Connection Errors Fixed**
- **Problem**: Intrusive transport connection error dialogs
- **Solution**: Improved error handling with graceful status indicators
- **Result**: Transport errors no longer interfere with chat functionality

## ðŸ§ª **All APIs Tested and Working**

âœ… Chat API (Port 5001): Working correctly  
âœ… Transport API (Port 8083): Working correctly  
âœ… TTS API: Working with audio generation and translation

1. **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go on your mobile device
2. **Try the chat** - conversations will persist when you close/reopen
3. **Test TTS** - tap speaker icons next to bot messages
