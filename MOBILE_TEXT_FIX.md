# 📱 Mobile Text Visibility - FIXED

## ❌ **Issue on Mobile:**

Chat was working but message text was invisible on mobile devices:
- Green message bubbles were visible
- Speaker icons were visible  
- But no message text was showing
- Worked perfectly on web version

## ✅ **Root Cause Identified:**

The `ThemedText` component was overriding the explicit white text color with its own color scheme logic, causing text to be invisible against the green message backgrounds on mobile.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied:**

### **Changed in `app/(app)/persona-ai.tsx`:**

```typescript
// BEFORE (invisible text):
<ThemedText style={styles.messageText}>{message.text}</ThemedText>

// AFTER (visible text):
<Text style={styles.messageText}>{message.text}</Text>
```

### **What Changed:**
1. **Replaced `ThemedText` with regular `Text`** for all message content
2. **Explicit white color** (`#FFFFFF`) now properly applied
3. **Added `Text` import** from React Native
4. **Fixed Kannada text display** as well
5. **Fixed loading message text**

## 📱 **Test the Fix:**

1. **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go
2. **Open the chat** (tap "Ask EMoo AI")
3. **Send a message** like "Hello" or "Help"
4. **✅ Verify**: Message text should now be **clearly visible** in white on the green bubbles

## 🎯 **What Should Work Now:**

- ✅ **Message text visible** on mobile
- ✅ **User messages** (blue bubbles) with white text
- ✅ **Bot responses** (green bubbles) with white text  
- ✅ **Loading indicator** text visible
- ✅ **Conversation history** persists
- ✅ **TTS buttons** functional (speaker icons)

## 🔍 **Expected Results:**

After sending a message, you should see:
1. **Your message** in a blue bubble with clear white text
2. **Bot response** in a green bubble with clear white text
3. **Speaker icon** next to bot messages for TTS
4. **Messages persist** when closing/reopening chat

## 🚀 **Ready to Test:**

The text visibility issue is now fixed. Your chat should display message content properly on mobile devices, matching the functionality of the web version.

If you're still seeing issues, try:
1. **Force refresh** the Expo app
2. **Clear Metro cache**: restart with `npx expo start --clear`
3. **Check device**: ensure you're using the latest Expo Go app
